**Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning**

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can distinguish between real and fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. With the overwhelming amount of information online, detecting misinformation is more critical than ever. This solution leverages classic ML algorithms and TF-IDF vectorization to tackle the problem.

 üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle - Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).  
It contains two CSV files:
- `True.csv` ‚Äì Articles from real news sources
- `Fake.csv` ‚Äì Articles flagged as fake

Both datasets include the article‚Äôs title, text, subject, and publication date.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Google Colab** (runtime)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` for ML models and evaluation
  - `nltk` for text processing (stopword removal, stemming)
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualizations
  - `joblib` for saving models

## üîç Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Merging**  
   Combined the real and fake datasets into a single DataFrame, then shuffled for randomness.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Checked for missing values  
   - Visualized class distribution  
   - Combined `title` and `text` columns for more context

3. **Text Preprocessing**  
   - Converted text to lowercase  
   - Removed punctuation, numbers, and stopwords  
   - Applied stemming using NLTK‚Äôs PorterStemmer  

4. **Feature Extraction**  
   Used TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert cleaned text into numerical features, limiting to the top 5,000 features.

5. **Model Training**  
   Trained two different classifiers:
   - **Logistic Regression**
   - **Passive Aggressive Classifier**  
   Both trained on 75% of the data, tested on the remaining 25%.

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score reported  
   - Confusion matrix visualizations provided for both models

7. **Model Saving**  
   Saved trained models and TF-IDF vectorizer using `joblib` for future use.

## üìä Results

Both models performed strongly with high accuracy and F1-scores. Passive Aggressive Classifier showed slightly better performance, especially in handling the imbalance between real and fake articles.

---

## üíæ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the `True.csv` and `Fake.csv` files (from Kaggle).
3. Run the cells sequentially.
4. Optional: Save and reuse the trained model (`.pkl` files).
